## Our Mission
**CaloBro** empowers students and health enthusiasts to navigate nutrition with ease. Our goal is to help you build healthier habits without the stress of manual calculations. Focus on enjoying your meals and we’ll handle the rest.

## Why This Exists
University students and busy individuals often struggle to maintain healthy eating habits, not because they don’t care, but because tracking nutrition is time-consuming and overwhelming.

Most calorie-tracking apps require:
- Manual searching
- Manual logging
- Manual portion estimation
- Constant calculation
  
That friction leads to inconsistency, and inconsistency breaks habits.

**CaloBro exists to remove that friction.**

We wanted to create a tool that:
- Lets you scan your food instead of typing everything
- Uses AI to estimate nutrition instantly
- Automatically tracks your daily and weekly intake
- Gamifies consistency with streaks and achievements
- Provides supportive AI-based nutrition advice
  
Instead of obsessing over numbers, users can focus on building sustainable habits.

## Key Features

1. **Quick Calorie Check**
- Instantly identify calories and macros in your meals using AI-powered image recognition.
- Snap a picture or upload a photo, and **CaloBro** does the rest.
2. **Smart Logging**
- Automatically log your consumption into your daily summary and track long-term goals.
- Monitor calories, protein, carbs, and fat, daily and weekly.
3. **AI Nutrition Coach**
- Chat with our AI assistant for personalized meal advice and health tips.
- Get nutrition guidance for stress, illness, or special conditions (e.g., period, flu).
4. **Motivation Streaks**
- Gamify your nutrition journey with logging streaks, calorie streaks, and protein streaks.
- Visualize your progress with graphs of your last 7 days.
5. **Set Your Goals**
- Define daily goals for calories, protein, carbs, and fat.
- Progress bars help you stay motivated and on track.
6. **Food Search & Addition**
- Search for food by name or description.
- Get instant nutrition info and add it to your daily summary.

## How It Works
1. **Daily Summary**: Track your calories, protein, carbs, and fat with a visual progress bar.
2. **Scan Food**: Upload or snap photos to automatically log nutrition.
3. **Search Food**: Look up foods and optionally add them to your summary.
4. **AI Advice**: Ask our AI nutrition coach for instant guidance.
5. **Set Goals**: Customize daily targets to stay motivated.
6. **Achievements**: Unlock streaks and see your weekly nutrition trends.

Note: Our AI provides smart estimations to promote nutritional awareness. While not 100% absolute, it’s a powerful guide toward healthier eating.
